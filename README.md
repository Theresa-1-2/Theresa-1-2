- **Name**: Title of the book.
- **Author**: Author of the book.
- **User Rating**: Average user rating on a scale of 1-5.
- **Reviews**: Number of user reviews.
- **Price**: Price of the book in dollars.
- **Year**: Year of publication.
- **Genre**: Genre of the book (Fiction/Non-Fiction).

## Features

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Address missing values and outliers.
   - Ensure the dataset is ready for exploration.

2. **Data Exploration**:
   - Statistical summaries.
   - Visualization of distributions, correlations, and trends.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Transforming features to improve model performance.

4. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Experimentation with regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and others.

5. **Streamlit Web Application**:
   - User-friendly interface for exploring the dataset and making predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model development.
- **Streamlit**: For creating the web application.
